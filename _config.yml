intro: |
  I am an engineer with almost 10 years of experience working in technology. I have primarily worked  as a server admin, facing many problems related to database synchronization, data replica, manage of roles, permissions, concurrence witha pplications and security. My obsession for automate tasks and be more productive give me the chance to be in charge of projects related to working in real time, with thousands of clients around my country. After that, I have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon Java, .NET, SQL, Javascript, Node, Mongo and most recently .NET Core and Spring. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery.
  I enjoy building interesting products, with a good Product Management focus and a good emphasis on good engineering principles and clean code. I prefeer estructured methodologies like TDD, because give you more confident deliveries
  I have worked in large scale consultancy roles across Europe, Asia and Latin America, and the most satisfying thing has been to teach my team the technology, best practices and be disruptive, because Agile metodologies like Scrum if are planned are incredible powerful.
